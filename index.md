### About me

I received the B.S. degree in Process Equipment and Control Engineering from Dalian University of Technology (DUT), Dalian, China, in 2020. I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at [Shenlab](http://www.shenlab.info) in Department of Biomedical Engineering from City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. My research interests include micro-swimming and active matter.
